# TMP117
Micropython module for TMP117 Texas Instruments temperature sensor.

Just connect your TMP117 board to Arduino, ESP or any other board with MicroPython firmware.

Supply voltage TMP117 3.3 or 5.0 volts! Use four wires to connect (I2C).
1. +VCC (Supply voltage)
2. GND
3. SDA
4. SCL

Upload micropython firmware to the NANO(ESP, etc) board, and then two files: main.py and tmp117ti.py. 
Then open main.py in your IDE and run it.
